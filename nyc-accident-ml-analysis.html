        <!-- Project Overview -->
        <section>
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project aims to analyze and predict traffic patterns in New York City using various machine learning models. The project is broken down into several stages, which include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of machine learning algorithms to make predictions based on the cleaned traffic data.

            <!-- Data Cleaning -->
            <h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
            <p>
                The first step involves cleaning the NYC traffic dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Key techniques used include imputing missing values, removing irrelevant features, and transforming data into a usable format.

            <!-- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) -->
            <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
            <p>
                EDA is used to understand the dataset and uncover patterns, correlations, and insights through visualizations and statistical analysis. This phase helps identify key traffic trends and relationships between variables such as time of day, location, weather, etc.

            <!-- Linear Regression Model -->
            <h3>Linear Regression Model</h3>
            <p>
                A linear regression model is used to establish a relationship between traffic volumes and other continuous variables. This model is useful for making simple, interpretable predictions. Key metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are used to evaluate model performance.

            <!-- Random Forest Model -->
            <h3>Random Forest Model</h3>
            <p>
                A more complex Random Forest model is employed to capture non-linear patterns in the data and improve predictive accuracy. This model is particularly good at handling large datasets and capturing feature importance.

            <!-- Neural Network Model -->
            <h3>Neural Network Model</h3>
            <p>
                A neural network model is developed to predict traffic flow with a more complex architecture that can capture deeper relationships within the dataset. Performance is measured using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

            <h2>Conclusions and Findings</h2>
            <p>
                Insights drawn from the models include factors most influencing NYC traffic and the accuracy of each model's performance. The project also discusses the limitations of the models and potential improvements for future work.
